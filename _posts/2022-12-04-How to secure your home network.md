## Introduction


Most homes nowadays contain a router/modem device, which receives and broadcasts internet (provided by a local ISP). In a home environment, there are many threats that homeowners don’t consider when adding devices to their network. This is especially true with the increase of IoT devices. 

### The Biggest Threats


It’s important to consider ways to better-secure your home network from internal and external threats. See below for routine threats that homeowners may face:

- Internal users not exercising caution with what they do (and download) online. Untrained/uneducated users are unaware of how their online behavior may put their home network at risk.
- IoT devices that are outdated, poorly coded, or possibly malicious. It’s also important that IoT devices are setup to receive automatic updates.
- Routers and SSIDs that are using poor, or default, credentials.

## Securing Your Home Network


These following methods will allow you to be better protected and make it more difficult for attackers if they try to break into your network. You’ll be able to perform these methods by accessing your home router (opening a web browser and going to *192.168.0.1* or *192.168.1.1*). 

1. **Update the router’s default credentials** → When initially setting up your home router, be sure to update those default credentials that are pre-assigned to your router.
2. **Update the SSID** (WiFi broadcast name) → The default SSID of a router will provide its product/model name. That information could be utilized by attackers as they’d only need to research what vulnerabilities your router may possess.   
3. **Use WPA2/WPA3**.
4. **Consider not broadcasting your SSID**. 
5. **Update the router’s firmware** → Also, make sure that “Auto-Update” is enabled so the firmware will always remain up-to-date. 
6. **Enable the router’s firewall**. 
7. **Disable the “WPS (WiFi Protected Setup)” feature**.
8. **Disable the “UPnP” feature** → Lately, this has been considered a possible security risk. 
9. **Disable the “Remote Control/Management/Administration” feature** → Not all routers contain this setting. It may be in the “Security” settings of your router’s settings. It’s rare that a home user would want to update router settings when they’re away from their home.
10. **Use a different DNS** → Consider updating the default DNS server. There are alternative (and free) options available that may increase your internet speed and security. 
    1. Google: 8.8.8.8 & 8.8.4.4
    2. Cloud Flare: 1.1.1.1 & 1.0.0.1
    3. OpenDNS
    4. Pi-Hole
11. **Use MAC address filtering**.
12. **Create a Guest WiFi network** → Allows visitors and devices (i.e. IoT) to connect to a network separate from your main network.
