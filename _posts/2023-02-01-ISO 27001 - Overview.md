## Introduction

The Information Security Management Standard (ISO 27001) was first published in 2005 and has now seen a recent update in 2022. The ISO 27001 is the international standard used to mitigate InfoSec risks that an organization may face. The new ISO 27001:2022 comes with moderate updates to its Information Security Controls, which addresses the increasing sophistication of evolving security challenges. An ISO 27001 certification audit occurs in a 3-year cycle. 

- Other related ISO standards:
    - **ISO 27002** → covers the implementation of the 27001 InfoSec controls.
    - **ISO 27701** → covers privacy controls
    - **ISO 31000** → covers risk management programs

## The ISO 27001 Certification


An Information Security Management System (ISMS) is an approach to maintaining an organization's information security. An ISMS may be certified compliant with ISO 27001 through an audit process. This process consists of a three-stage external audit (defines by ISO 17021 & 27006 standards).

**Stage 1**: It’s an informal, preliminary review of an organization’s ISMS. This review will involve checks of an organization’s key documentation, such as their Risk Treatment Plan, Statement of Applicability, and Information Security policy.

**Stage 2**: Involves independently testing an organization's ISMS against ISO 27001 requirements. This stage is the detailed and formal compliance audit portion. The auditors (ISO 27001 Lead Auditors) will search for evidence that the ISMS has been designed and implemented properly, while also being in operation. Organizations that pass this stage will have their ISMS certified as compliant with ISO 27001.

**Stage 3 (Ongoing)**: This stage involves routine follow-up reviews or audits. Periodic re-assessments will confirm that the organization still remains in compliance with the ISO 27001 standard, and that their ISMS continues to operate as specified and intended. These re-assessments are conducted at least annually but are often conducted more frequently.
