## Summary

The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) is a well-known and frequently-utilized framework for managing organizational risk. The NIST RMF is a systematic process developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to assist organizations in managing cybersecurity risks and improving their overall security posture. It emphasizes a proactive and continuous approach to identifying, assessing, mitigating, and monitoring information systems and data risks. 

NIST SP 800-37, titled "Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations", provides detailed guidance on implementing the NIST RMF. 

## The 6 RMF Steps

> Note: Each step of the RMF also include relevant NIST Special Publications (SP) that may be utilized. These SPs collectively provide the necessary guidance, control requirements, assessment methodologies, and best practices to implement the NIST RMF effectively.

1. __Categorize [Information Systems]__:
   Organizations identify and categorize information systems and data based on factors such as importance, sensitivity, and potential impact. This step lays the foundation for determining appropriate security controls.

   > Note: These publications help organizations categorize their information systems based on the types of information they handle and their corresponding security categories. This categorization is essential for determining appropriate security controls:
   > * NIST SP 800-60 Volume I: Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories
   > * NIST SP 800-60 Volume II: Appendices to Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories 
   {: .prompt-info }

2. __Select [Security Controls]__:
   Security controls are selected from NIST Special Publication 800-53 based on the categorized systems.
   Controls are chosen to address specific risks associated with the systems.

   > Note: These documents provide a comprehensive list of security controls and associated assessment procedures. Organizations use these controls to select measures that align with their systems' categorized risks:
   > * NIST SP 800-53: Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations
   > * NIST SP 800-53A: Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Federal Information Systems and Organizations 
   {: .prompt-info }

3. __Implement [Security Controls]__:
   Organizations implement the selected security controls by configuring hardware, software, policies, and procedures.
   The goal is to establish necessary security measures to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

   > Note: These resources provide guidelines for using checklists to implement security controls (NIST SP 800-70), as well as ensures proper implementation of controls in specific products and solutions (vendor documentation):
   > * NIST SP 800-70 Rev. 4: National Checklist Program for IT Products - Guidelines for Checklist Users and Developers
   > * Vendor-specific guidelines and documentation - for implementing security controls in hardware, software, and systems
   {: .prompt-info }

4. __Assess [Security Controls]__:
   Security controls' effectiveness is assessed through security testing, reviews, and evaluations.
   Organizations ensure that controls are functioning as intended and providing the desired level of protection.

   > Note: NIST SP 800-53A outlines assessment procedures, SP 800-115 provides guidance on security testing, and SP 800-53B provides control baselines to assess against. These documents aid in evaluating the effectiveness of security controls:
   > * NIST SP 800-53A: Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Federal Information Systems and Organizations
   > * NIST SP 800-115: Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment
   > * NIST SP 800-53B: Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organizations
   {: .prompt-info }

5. __Authorize [Information Systems]__:
   Based on assessment results, organizations make an authorization decision.
   This decision considers residual risks and determines if the system is authorized for operation.

   > Note: NIST SP 800-37 provides guidance on authorization decision-making, while SP 800-53A and SP 800-53B support the assessment of controls' effectiveness:
   > * NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2: Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations
   > * NIST SP 800-53A: Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Federal Information Systems and Organizations
   > * NIST SP 800-53B: Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organizations
   {: .prompt-info }

6. __Monitor [Security Controls]__:
   Continuous monitoring practices are established to track the system's security posture over time.
   This involves ongoing assessment, anomaly detection, and proactive response to emerging threats.

   > Note: NIST SP 800-137 offers guidance on continuous monitoring, while SP 800-53A and SP 800-137A provide guidance on assessing controls and building effective assessment plans for continuous monitoring:
   > * NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2: Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations
   > * NIST SP 800-53A: Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Federal Information Systems and Organizations
   > * NIST SP 800-53B: Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organizations
   {: .prompt-info }

The NIST RMF emphasizes a continuous and iterative approach to cybersecurity. It provides organizations with a structured, standardized methodology for managing risks, protecting information systems, and enhancing security practices. Following these guidelines helps organizations adapt to evolving threats and vulnerabilities while maintaining a robust cybersecurity posture.
