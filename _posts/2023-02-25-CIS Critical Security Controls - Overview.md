## Introduction
These 20 critical security controls (CSC) were developed by the Center for Internet Security (CIS) and the SANS Institute. This framework is presented in a format that can be easily adapted by any organization to better prepare themselves against cyber attacks and to protect critical data assets. We only found one and that's on the 3rd floor I believe the one it was on the 2nd was replaced with a camera because we're not locating the other disk. 

## Structure
The 20 CSC are separated into three implementation levels: 
<br>
* [A] **Basic Level** — Applying controls 1 – 6, and is advised for all organizations. These six controls can be implemented with conservative resources, and will provide a basic level of protection that even the smallest of organizations can utilize.
* [B] **Foundational Level** — Applying the basic controls and controls 7 – 16, and is advised for mid-level organizations that have more resources and cybersecurity professionals to implement security measures**.**
* [C] **Organizational Level** — Applying all 20 controls, and is intended for developed organizations that have robust cybersecurity expertise and extensive resources.
