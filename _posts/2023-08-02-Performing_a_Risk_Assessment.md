## Introduction

A cyber risk assessment involves systematically identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing potential cybersecurity risks to the organization's information systems, data, and operations. This process helps organizations understand the cybersecurity threats they face and take appropriate measures to mitigate those risks.

## Risk Assessment Phases

The phases of a cyber risk assessment typically include:

1. __Scope and Goal Definition__:
  Clearly define the scope of the assessment, specifying the systems, applications, networks, and data that will be assessed. Determine the goals of the assessment, such as identifying vulnerabilities, assessing potential impacts, and recommending mitigation strategies.

2. __Asset Inventory and Classification__:
  Create an inventory of digital assets, including hardware, software, applications, data repositories, third-party services, intellectual property, and critical infrastructure. Classify assets based on their sensitivity and criticality to the organization.

3. __Threat and Vulnerability Identification__:
  Identify potential threats that could target the organization. This includes external threats like cybercriminals, nation-state actors, and internal threats such as insider threats.
  Assess the organization's systems and applications to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by cyber threats. This involves using scanning tools, penetration testing, and vulnerability databases.  

4. __Risk Analysis and Calculation__:
  Calculate the risk level for each identified threat-vulnerability pair by combining the likelihood and impact scores (Risk = Impact x Likelihood). For the example scenario below, we'll use a scale of 1 to 5 for both impact and likelihood (where 1 represents the lowest and 5 represents the highest).
   __Scenario: DDoS Attack Risk Assessment__
   1. Likelihood Assessment:
     * Likelihood of a DDoS attack: __4__ (based on historical trends and increased prevalence of DDoS attacks in the industry).
   2. Impact Assessment:
     * Financial impact of website outage: 3 (Moderate)
     * Operational impact: 5 (Severe)
   3. Quantitative Risk Calculation:
      * Likelihood: __4__ (out of 5)
      * Impact: 3 + 5 = __8__ (sum of financial and operational impact values)
   __Risk Calculation and Classification__
   * Calculated Risk Score: __4__ Ã— __8__ = __32__
   * The calculated risk score of 32 indicates a significant risk level for this DDoS attack scenario. (Note: organizations may tailor the impact and likelihood scales to their specific needs, incorporating additional factors such as control effectiveness or regulatory compliance) 
    
5. __Risk Prioritization__:
   Prioritize risks based on their calculated risk levels. Focus on high-priority risks that have significant potential impact and likelihood.

6. __Control Assessment__:
  Evaluate the effectiveness of existing cybersecurity controls and measures in place to mitigate the recently-identified risks. Determine whether these controls adequately address the risks or if further enhancements are necessary.

7. __Risk Treatment and Mitigation__:
  Develop and recommend risk mitigation strategies and controls to address the identified vulnerabilities. These strategies may involve implementing technical controls, improving processes, providing training, and more.

8. __Residual Risk Assessment__:
  Assess the residual risk that still remains following the application of the mitigation strategies. This residual risk represents the risk level that the organization must accept or manage based on its risk tolerance.

9. __Report Creation__:
  Compile a comprehensive report that includes details of the identified threats, vulnerabilities, risk analysis, prioritization, recommended mitigation strategies, and residual risk assessment. The report should be tailored for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

10. __Communication and Decision-Making__:
  Present the comprehensive report (of findings and recommendations) to relevant stakeholders, including management and technical teams. Use the assessment results to inform decision-making, resource allocation, and cybersecurity strategies.

11. __Implementation and Monitoring__:
  Implement the recommended mitigation strategies and controls. Continuously monitor the effectiveness of these measures and adjust them as needed based on changes in the threat landscape or the organization's environment.

12. __Continuous Improvement__:
Regularly review and update the cyber risk assessment to account for changes in the organization's systems, technologies, and emerging cybersecurity threats. This ensures that the assessment remains relevant and up-to-date.

By following these phases, organizations can gain insights into their cybersecurity risks, develop informed strategies to address those risks, and create a more resilient and secure digital environment.

It's important to note that conducting a cyber risk assessment requires a combination of technical expertise, understanding of the organization's operations, and knowledge of cybersecurity best practices. Organizations may choose to engage internal teams or seek assistance from external cybersecurity experts to ensure a comprehensive and effective assessment.
