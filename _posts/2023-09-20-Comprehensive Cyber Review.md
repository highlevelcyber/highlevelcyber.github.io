**Data-Flow Diagram** 

- **Data-Flow Diagram**: Explaining the flow of data within an application for identifying security vulnerabilities.
- **Source Code Scan**: Techniques for scanning source code for vulnerabilities, including Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Open Source Scan.
    - **SAST**: Static Analysis Security Testing.
    - **Open Source Scan**: Identifying vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- **API Security**: Ensuring the security of Application Programming Interfaces.
- **Security QA**: Quality assurance practices with a security focus.
- **Security UX**: Incorporating security into the user experience design.
- **S-SDLC** (Security Software Development Life Cycle): Integrating security throughout the software development process.
    - **“Shift Left”**: Early integration of security in development.
    - **CI/CD Integration**: Security in continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines.
